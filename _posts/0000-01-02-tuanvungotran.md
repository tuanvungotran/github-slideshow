"Welcome to my second slide".

Hi everyone, this is the first time I do something with Github. Because i have learned about coding for 3 month and starting with Java. I want to become a QA Engineer. And i come to Github.
I am learning everyday to get better coding skill. Hope everything will be fine.
I'm going to be 32 years old this year, I have to work harder to have a job soon.
